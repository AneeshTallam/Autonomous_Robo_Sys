PWM pins: 3,5,6,9,10,11
Digital side ground: 4th bokka from top

Plan

1) connect accelerometer

4 connections: SCL, SDA, power, GND
SCL: Arduino uno top bokka
SDA: The bokka below SCL

check using accel_check code

2) connect DC motor using NPN transistor and a diode

Transistor: Has 3 legs
middle leg: to a 1K ohm resistor, other leg of resistor to pin 9
one end: GND
other end: unstriped side of diode

Diode:
striped side - below: to 5V, above: to DC motor
unstriped side- below: coming from transistor, above: to other terminal of DC motor


Refer to transistor wiring.png, use DC_motor_check code

3) Check if tilt changes speed using tilt_to_control_speed code

4) Connect 7 segment display using shift register

Refer to shift register pinout.png (Remember QA pin on the other side)
SER: pin 8
SRCLK: pin 12
RCLK: pin 11
OE: GND
SRCLR: Power
VCC, GND for register

segment connections
Place resistors in between
Refer to 7_segment_pinout.png 
a to QA, b to QB,..... 
All correct: QH must be left at end
common pin to GND

check connections using segment_display_check

5) Show speed on display using tilt_and_speed_display

6) Connect a servo motor
red : Power
brown: GND
yellow: Arduino pin 6

check using servo_check

7) Complete speed req using tilt_with_display_and_servo 

8) Check fall detection working or not using prev_code_with_fall_detect

9) Connect joystick
VRx: A0
VRy: A1
SW: pin 7
GND and power

check using joystick_check

10) check drone mode working or not using prev_code_with_drone_mode

11) Connect ultrasound sensor
Power
GND
Trigger pin: pin 5
Echo pin: pin 4

12) check braking condition using prev_code_with_distance_braking

13) Connect a photoresistor. One leg to GND, other to a resistor, A2 pin in the same line and power to the other leg of normal resistor

14) Connect an LED. Long leg to pin 3, short leg to resistor and other resistor leg to GND

15) Connect a potentiometer. Edge legs to GND and power, middle leg to A3 pin. Use photoresistor_and_pot code for checking

Tasks to complete:
Check if new accel speed logic working using tilt_to_control_speed
Check new joystick speed logic working with using prev_code_with_distance_braking
